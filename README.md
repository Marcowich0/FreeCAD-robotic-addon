# FreeCAD Robotic Addon

### About This Project -- Under Development --

This repository contains the FreeCAD Robotic Addon, developed as part of Marc Clausen's Master Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

### Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to design a dedicated FreeCAD workbench that provides an intuitive and straightforward method for robot control, even for users with minimal or no knowledge of kinematics. 

Key features include:

- **Custom Object Integration**: The workbench enables seamless control of robots by adding custom objects to existing assemblies.
- **Trajectory Planning**: Simplified trajectory planning based on FreeCAD geometries.
- **Advanced Functionality**: While the initial focus is on ease of use, the project will incorporate advanced features aimed at academic research. These advanced tools may also find practical applications for broader use cases.
